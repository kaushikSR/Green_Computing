# Automatic Detection of PV arrays and extracting its features from Aerial Satellite Imagery

## Dataset Column Descriptions (few columns not used):
polygon_id -> Each PV array corresponds to a polygon <br>
centroid_latitude/centroid_longitude -> latitude and longitude of the centroid of the polygon <br>
centroid_latitude_pixels/centroid_longitude_pixels -> pixel co-ordinates of the centroid of the polygon <br>
city -> location of the PV array <br>
area_pixels -> Area given by Google Earth when you draw a polygon around the PV array <br>
image_name -> image containing the PV array <br>
nw_corner_of_image_latitude/nw_corner_of_image_longitude/se_corner_of_image_latitude/se_corner_of_image_longitude -> latitudes and longitudes of the corners of the image. <br>
resolution -> meters per pixel <br>
