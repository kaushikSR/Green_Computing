centroid_latitude/centroid_longitude -> latitude and longitude of the centroid of the polygon
centroid_latitude_pixels/centroid_longitude_pixels -> pixel co-ordinates of the centroid of the polygon
city -> location of the PV array
area_pixels -> Area given by Google Earth when you draw a polygon around the PV array
image_name -> image containing the PV array
nw_corner_of_image_latitude/nw_corner_of_image_longitude/se_corner_of_image_latitude/se_corner_of_image_longitude -> latitudes and longitudes of the corners of the image.
resolution -> meters per pixel
